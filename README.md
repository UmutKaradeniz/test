DELIVERY SERVICE WEBSITE PROJECT

OVERVIEW

This project is a web-based application designed for a delivery service company, similar to "Lieferando." The application was developed as part of our university "University of Duisburg-Essen" coursework to 
demonstrate proficiency in web development using HTML, Python, Flask, and SQLite.

The website allows users to browse restaurants, place orders, and track their deliveries. It features a responsive frontend and a backend for handling user data, orders, and restaurant information.
